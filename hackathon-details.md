# PROBLEM STATEMENT

```
LIGMA - Let’s Integrate Groups, Manage Anything
Virtual Collaboration Workspace
```
### Note to Participants

You are completely free to use any AI tool for support. Although, the evaluation (excluding
frontend) will be based on your design knowledge and the architectural design decisions.
**USE OF PAID 3RD PARTY INTEGRATIONS WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE
DISQUALIFICATION.**

## 01 Background

Modern remote teams operate across fragmented toolchains — a whiteboard for ideation,
a task manager for execution, a chat tool for decisions. The cognitive cost of context-
switching during a live brainstorm kills momentum: a great idea scribbled on a sticky note
becomes a lost action item because nobody transferred it to the project tracker.

Existing tools either solve the canvas problem (Figma, Miro) or the task management
problem (Notion, Linear) — but none bridge the gap in real time, at the moment the idea
is born.

## 02 The Challenge

Build **LIGMA** — a real-time collaborative workspace that bridges ideation and execution.
Teams brainstorm on a shared infinite canvas; the platform automatically extracts intent
from canvas content and populates a live task board — no copy-paste, no context
switching.
LIGMA is intentionally scoped: it is not a full Figma clone. It is a purpose-built
brainstorming tool that produces structured, actionable output the moment a session
ends.


## 03 Core Requirements

### The Canvas

- Infinite canvas with sticky notes, freehand drawing, shapes, and text blocks.
- Multiple users can edit simultaneously in real time (no page refresh).
- Each canvas element (node) is an independently addressable object.
- Cursor presence — each user's cursor is visible to all participants.

### Intent-Aware Task Extraction

- As users write on canvas nodes, an AI layer classifies intent: action item, decision,
    open question, or reference.
- Nodes tagged as action items automatically appear in a structured Task Board
    panel.
- Tasks carry the original author, timestamp, and a link back to the canvas node —
    no data is duplicated.

### Node-Level Access Control

- Individual canvas nodes can be locked to specific roles (e.g., Lead, Contributor,
    Viewer).
- A "Lead" can lock the architecture diagram while contributors can still comment on
    it.

### Append-Only Event Log

- Every mutation to the canvas is stored as an immutable event. The logs can be
    viewed in a bar on the side.

### Real-Time WebSocket Management

- The system must handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections, broadcast
    canvas deltas (not full state) efficiently, and recover gracefully when a client
    reconnects after a drop — replaying only missed events.

### Deployment of the module on Render

- In order to be judged it's important to deploy the finished project onto Render.


## 04 Technical Challenges

The following challenges go beyond standard CRUD. Teams must demonstrate
understanding of the underlying problem, not just a working UI.

1. **Challenge 01: Conflict Resolution (CRDT / OT)**
    When two users simultaneously edit the same canvas node, implement proper
    merge logic — not "last write wins." The canvas must converge to a consistent,
    correct state across all connected clients. This is what Figma and Google Docs
    actually do under the hood.
2. **Challenge 02: Node-Level RBAC**
    Most apps enforce permissions at the room level. LIGMA requires per-node
    permissions. Individual canvas elements must carry their own ACL, enforced both
    client-side (UI affordances) and server-side (mutation validation).
3. **Challenge 03: Intent-Aware Task Extraction**
    As users write on canvas nodes, an AI layer classifies intent: action item, decision,
    open question, or reference.
4. **Challenge 04: Append-Only Event Log**
    Append-Only Event Log Every mutation to the canvas is stored as an immutable
    event. The logs can be viewed in a bar on the side.
5. **Challenge 05: Real-Time WebSocket Management**
    Real-Time WebSocket Management The system must handle multiple concurrent
    WebSocket connections, broadcast canvas deltas (not full state) efficiently, and
    recover gracefully when a client reconnects after a drop — replaying only missed
    events.
6. **Challenge 06: Deployment of the module on Render**
    Deployment of the module on Render In order to be judged it's important to deploy
    the finished project onto Render.

## 05 Creative Features (Bonus)

These features are optional but reward teams that plan their architecture well in Stage 1:

- **Presence Heatmap:** Visual overlay showing which canvas zones received the
    most edits and attention during the session.
- **Time-Travel Replay:** Scrub through session history like a video timeline —
    watch the brainstorm unfold step by step.
- **AI Summary Export:** One-click export of the canvas content into a structured
    brief: decisions made, tasks assigned, open questions.
- **Presence Zones:** Named focus areas on the canvas that display which team
    members are currently active in each zone.
**Note to participants:** You are not expected to build all four creative features. One well-
implemented bonus feature with a clear architecture is worth more than four half-finished
ones.

## 07 Judging Notes

- **Partial credit** is independent per criterion. If conflict resolution works but the
    README has no explanation, judges award the WebSocket points but dock the
    evolution rationale points separately.
- **Server-side enforcement** is mandatory for security criteria. Client-only guards
    earn zero on RBAC — judges will test by sending a raw WebSocket or curl
    request.
- **Live demo is required.** Screenshots and videos do not substitute for a working
    demo on any criterion marked with a curl / DevTools / tab-switching test action.
- **Stage 1 (Architecture Presentation)** scores feed into Category 5. Teams that
    plan well and articulate their choices clearly earn the uniqueness points even if
    their implementation is incomplete.
